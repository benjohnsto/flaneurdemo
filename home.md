Playing around with Jekyll with this cool project.

[Flâneur](https://github.com/kirschbombe/flaneur) is a Jekyll map-based theme using the Leaflet JavaScript library for presenting maps and text together. To see a real-world use case, visit the [Los Angeles: The City and the Library](https://citystoriesucla.github.io/lyricalmap/) project.

Flâneur was developed by Dawn Childress and ported to Jekyll by Dawn Childress & Niqui O'Neill. It is based on the original [Boulevardier](https://github.com/kirschbombe/boulevardier) framework developed by Dawn Childress & Nathan Day.
