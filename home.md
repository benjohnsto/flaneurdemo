This website is a demonstration of the Fl√¢neur jekyll theme. This theme combines text and images with a map to create a website hosted on GitHub and made available via GitHub Pages. While using GitHub for course projects may present some technical challenges, it is also a platform that many undergraduates already use for other coursework and that provides a useful introduction to a very common tool for digital scholarship.
